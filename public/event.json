        "short_description": "The refugee camps in Cox's Bazar have a very high population density, in some areas significantly higher than the most densely populated cities in the world. This results in insufficient coverage of WASH facilities and inadequate access to services and creates residential safety risks including vulnerability to fire and natural disasters. With a view to mitigating these issues, UNHCR and partners have introduced double-story shelters to make use of limited space and to ensure space for fire breaks, in consultation with the authorities. Although the Government hasapproved the construction of double-story shelters in some of the camps, UNHCR will continue to advocate for increase construction of such shelters.\r\n",
